## Crypto’s first credit cartel

IMF is a DeFi protocol lending stablecoins against any crypto asset.[^1]  

We unlock credit for the assets most protocols won’t touch. We bank the unbankable.

But IMF isn’t just infrastructure. It’s how communities take control.

Built on ruthless ambition, community collusion, and cartel-coded coordination. Secured by battle-tested primitives like [Morpho](https://docs.morpho.org){: target="_blank"}, [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org){: target="_blank"}, and [USDS](https://developers.sky.money){: target="_blank"} by Sky (formerly DAI by MakerDAO).

Coordination through credit. Collateral backed by conviction. Belief becomes buying power. Most protocols have a DAO. We have a chain of command.

Credit where credit is due. Welcome to the cartel.
