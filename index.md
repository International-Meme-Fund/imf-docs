In crypto, the default action is to sell. Need liquidity? Sell. Need to fund your idea? Sell. But selling kills momentum. It fractures communities. It bleeds value.

**IMF replaces selling with borrowing.** Instead of dumping tokens, holders and communities can unlock stable liquidity while staying long.

It’s not a grant program. It’s not a yield farm. It’s **Community Coordinated Credit:** an onchain system that turns belief into capital and capital into attention.

With IMF:

- Token holders **borrow instead of sell**
- Lenders **earn yield** on stablecoin deposits
- Communities **coordinate price action** with skin in the game

Built on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), [Morpho](https://morpho.org), and [USDS](https://sky.money), IMF is permissionless, immutable, and battle-tested from day one.

**Credit is a weapon. IMF helps you wield it.**
