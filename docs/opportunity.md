Unlocking stablecoin growth and the $13 trillion Eurodollar market.

## The Growing Stablecoin Market

The stablecoin market has surpassed $200 billion, reflecting its increasing significance in the financial ecosystem. In 2024 alone, stablecoins settled approximately $5.28 trillion in transactions, with half of this value processed on public blockchains. Despite this rapid expansion, stablecoins backed by cryptocurrencies account for less than 10% of the total market share, highlighting a critical gap in the ecosystem.

## The Structural Limitation of Existing Stablecoins

Most stablecoins today rely on traditional financial assets such as U.S. dollars held in bank reserves, Ethereum, or real-world assets (RWAs) like U.S. Treasury bills. While these assets provide stability, they introduce centralization risks and limit the scope of decentralized finance. Additionally, alternative asset classes---such as memecoins, cultural tokens, and highly liquid but unconventional cryptocurrencies---are often ignored due to their perceived lack of credibility.

## The $13 Trillion Eurodollar Opportunity

The Eurodollar market represents an estimated $13 trillion in USD-denominated financial activity occurring outside the United States. This global shadow banking system operates largely without direct oversight from U.S. regulators, creating inefficiencies that stablecoins are well-positioned to address. However, crypto-backed stablecoins have yet to capture this opportunity due to the constraints of collateral availability and governance-heavy frameworks.

## The Case for an Inclusive Collateral System

Maker DAO's DAI stablecoin demonstrated the viability of decentralized collateralized stablecoins. However, its governance model prioritizes "serious" assets, limiting participation from more speculative but highly liquid assets. This approach excludes a significant portion of the crypto market, particularly assets with strong cultural and global adoption. By unlocking this untapped potential, a new collateralization model can better serve the evolving demands of decentralized finance.

## What is IMF?

### Introducing IMF v2: Expanding Collateral Access

A next-generation decentralized collateralized debt position (CDP) system, IMF v2, revolutionizes stablecoin issuance by allowing any token to be deposited as collateral. This model enables:

- Expanded Asset Support: Incorporating a broader range of digital assets, including memecoins and culturally significant tokens.
- Stablecoin Borrowing: Providing liquidity through an overcollateralized lending framework.
- Uniswap Moment for CDPs: Democratizing stablecoin issuance, much like Uniswap transforming decentralized trading.

By enabling broader collateral inclusion, IMF v2 could facilitate stablecoin adoption at scale, accelerate the transition of financial activity onto blockchain-based platforms, and solidify crypto's role in the $13 trillion Eurodollar system. This innovation would mark a significant step towards further decentralization and the dominance of stablecoins in global finance.
