# Most tokens die.

Some die quietly. Others explode first, then fade into obscurity. 
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

But almost all follow the same trajectory: initial hype, short-term liquidity, long-term decay.

## Why?

Because crypto has a **coordination problem**. Value creation is disconnected from value capture. Builders receive grants or tokens upfront. Communities are given no real tools. Most tokens are sold. Not used.

This is the meta:

- Protocols raise with no plan for token demand  
- DAOs give grants with no strings attached  
- Farmers farm and dump  
- Buyers become bagholders  
- Narratives die  
- Communities fragment

Tokens aren’t productive. They’re dumped. And price action, which should be a coordination tool, becomes a source of instability.

**What if credit could change that?**

## Community Coordinated Credit

Grants aren't accountable. Selling is extractive. **Credit has skin in the game.**

IMF introduces **Community Coordinated Credit:** an onchain system where holders **borrow against their token instead of selling it**. A system where credit powers ideas, and repayment incentives tie success back to the token.

With IMF:

- Borrowers post token collateral to access [USDS](https://sky.money){: target="_blank"}  
- That USDS funds builders, memes and market activity, without dumping  
- Lenders earn yield from that usage  
- The token gains liquidity, attention, and belief  

This isn’t leverage for whales. It’s credit for communities. It’s a flywheel where conviction becomes capital.

## PvP vs PvE

**Memecoins** taught us something DeFi forgot: crypto isn't just player versus player, it's also player versus environment. Coordinated communities win.

Price movement captures attention. Attention drives growth. Growth drives conviction. Conviction creates a floor.

Tokens that coordinate around price survive.

IMF gives communities the tools to do that:

- **IMF Pool** creates liquidity and fee income  
- **Borrow** lets them access USDS without selling  
- **Lend** creates passive income and ecosystem alignment  

**Price action is no longer an accident. It’s coordinated.** With IMF, PvE becomes possible again.
