As new liquidity enters the IMF vault, the need to reallocate liquidity to supported markets arises, and [$IMF token](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x59d813c1d0266278e2f5f146c0e222a6cfea83df) holders direct the flow.

Signature-based proposals like this one are a temporary measure while the credit cartel moves toward a trustless onchain model. They effectively demonstrate the cartel's upcoming onchain liquidity logistics.

Use your $IMF to set your preferred liquidity allocations per market. Check back when you want to make an adjustment. Future iterations will not use token holdings as vote weight. Instead, vote weight will be based on $IMF posted as Morpho collateral. 

Credit is a weapon. $IMF is power. 

Debt before dishonor.
