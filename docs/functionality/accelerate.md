By using the Accelerate button, degens can go 150% long their token at 33% LTV all in the press of a single button. Combining various steps into one, the button:

1. Deposits token into IMF as collateral
2. Borrows USDS at 50% LTV by default
3. Buys more tokens and deposits again
4. Brings your LTV down to a safer 33%

This is credit as a weapon of mass disruption.

**Not for the faint hearted.**
