**For holders,** until now, the game was simple: hold or sell. Now there's a third move: borrow. Use your bags as collateral to unlock stablecoins – no selling, no cash outlay. Your bags stay yours. You just reload and rebuy. Your idle bags are now working for you, meaning you get to stay in the game.

By depositing a token as collateral, users can borrow [USDS](https://sky.money){: target="_blank"} directly from an **isolated onchain market**. Secured by [Morpho](https://morpho.org){: target="_blank"}, everything is immutable and non-custodial.

## How it works

- Borrowers can deposit a supported token as collateral  
- They can borrow USDS up to a 50% Loan To Value (LTV)
- Their position can be liquidated at 77% Liquidateable LTV (LLTV)
- Loans accrue interest and can be repaid when convenient
- Collateral can only be seized when LTV is 77% or more

Each Borrow market is **isolated:** one token, one oracle, one market. 

**No contagion risk across assets.**

## Why it matters

- No need to sell your token to access liquidity  
- Stay exposed while gaining stable working capital  
- Use USDS to fund growth or buy more tokens

**It’s credit, aligned with conviction.**
