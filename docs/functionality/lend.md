**For whales,** who don't just hold – they bankroll the operation. This is boss-level lending. Those who supply cartel capital are rewarded with juicy yields.

Lenders deposit [USDS](https://sky.money){: target="_blank"} into the IMF vault and earn interest paid by borrowers using its supported markets. It’s **onchain**, **permissionless**, and **liquid.** 

Secured by [Morpho](https://morpho.org){: target="_blank"}, with all risk fully contained.

## How it works

Each IMF market is deployed using Morpho’s [Multi-Market Factory](https://docs.morpho.org/overview/concepts/vault/){: target="_blank"}, with its own parameters, oracle, and risk model. 

- Isolated markets prevent cross-asset contagion  
- Immutable contracts enforce predictable logic  
- [Dynamic interest rates](https://docs.morpho.org/overview/concepts/irm){: target="_blank"} adapt to utilisation  
- Battle-tested infra securing billions

**Utilisation drives rates**, and the system is [transparent by design](https://data.imf.bz){: target="_blank"} .

## Why it matters

Lending on IMF is more than passive income. It’s a way to back conviction and earn yield from **community coordinated credit markets**.

- Earn real yield from actual borrower demand  
- Support the tokens and communities driven by belief
- Gain exposure beyond holding the underlying

No gimmicks. Just **real demand meeting real supply**.
