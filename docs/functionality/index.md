IMF works by coordinating community credit markets:

- **Lend** - Where lenders of USDS earn yield through [Morpho](https://docs.morpho.org){: target="_blank"} from borrowers
- **Borrow** - Where borrowers are issued [USDS](https://developers.sky.money/core-protocol/usds/){: target="_blank"} loans against their collateral  
- **Accelerate** - Where borrowers 150% long at 33% LTV in a single button
- **Amplify** - Where protocolized [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview){: target="_blank"} LPs auto-DCA into USDS yield 
- **Allocate** - Where leveraged $IMF directs liquidity flows to markets

Each of our vault's markets are isolated and immutable.
