IMF works by coordinating community credit markets:

- **Borrow** - Where borrowers are issued [USDS](https://developers.sky.money/core-protocol/usds/){: target="_blank"} loans against their collateral  
- **Lend** - Where lenders of USDS earn yield through [Morpho](https://docs.morpho.org/overview/){: target="_blank"} from borrowers
- **Pool** - Where protocol-optimized [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview){: target="_blank"} LPs auto-DCA into USDS yield 
- **Accelerate** - Where borrowers 150% long at 33% LTV in a single button

Each of our vault's markets are isolated and immutable.
