# IMF OS

IMF OS is the operating system for onchain credit.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

It looks like a desktop. Feels like an app launcher. And gives you direct access to every part of the IMF protocol.

**[IMF OS](https://app.imf.bz){: target="_blank"} gives you the tools to coordinate around credit.**

## Modules

- **Pool** - Deposit your token, earn LP fees, and feed the flywheel  
- **Borrow** - Post token collateral and access USDS  
- **Lend** - Supply USDS and earn interest from real demand  
- **Calc** - Model buying power and price impact based on 1.5x spot exposure at different participation rates

More modules will roll out as IMF expands. But every one is built to help users **act**, not just observe.

## Why It Matters

- Clean, modular interface built for action  
- Everything onchain, every click routes to contracts  
- A coordination layer for token communities, individuals, and DAOs

**IMF OS isn’t just a frontend.** It’s a credit terminal. A home base for building, borrowing, and bridging conviction into capital.

It’s not just what you see. It’s what you can do.
