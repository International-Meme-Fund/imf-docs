# IMF Token

$IMF is the ownership token of the protocol.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

It doesn’t control governance. It doesn’t issue emissions. It doesn’t vote on parameters.

Instead, it represents **economic ownership**. If someone wants to control IMF, they have to acquire the token, transparently, onchain.

This model is powered by [Salutary](https://salutary.io), a standard for building tokens with **credible ownership dynamics** and onchain acquisition logic.

## How It Works

- IMF earns a **6.9% performance fee** on interest paid by borrowers  
- Revenue accrues to the protocol’s treasury  
- Anyone who holds **51% of $IMF** controls the protocol  
- There are **no votes** and **no dilution mechanisms**

Ownership is not theoretical. It’s **economic and executable**. If the protocol becomes valuable, so does the token.

## Why It Matters

- **Aligned with usage** - more borrowing means more revenue, which strengthens the protocol  
- **Acquirable** - control is earned, not granted  
- **Simple and serious** - no governance theatre, just incentives that work

**The IMF token is a bet on community credit.** It’s a way to back the future of coordination, and own the rails that power it.

Startups need growth. Credit protocols need credibility. **$IMF gives you both.**
