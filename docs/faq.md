## What is IMF?

**IMF is a credit protocol** that lets anyone borrow against their tokens without selling. It combines liquidity provisioning (**Amplify**), stablecoin borrowing (**Borrow**), and stablecoin lending (**Lend**). All built on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), [Morpho](https://morpho.org), and [USDS](https://sky.money).

## What does IMF stand for?

It stands for “International Meme Fund” or, it’s simply **IMF**: a **credit cartel** for community credit coordination.

## What makes IMF different?

We unlock credit for the long tail. Not just blue chips. No governance theatre. Just real tools for token communities to coordinate growth and access stable liquidity.

## Who is IMF for?

- Token holders who want liquidity without selling  
- Token communities that want to build and grow  
- Lenders seeking yield from real borrower demand  
- Builders who want capital without relying on grants

## What do I get by using IMF?

- Borrowers unlock stable liquidity (USDS) while staying long  
- Lenders earn interest paid by real borrowers  
- Communities get **credit rails** that reinforce price, attention, and belief

## What happens if my token crashes?

If your collateral value drops below safe levels, a **liquidation** may occur to protect lenders. You don’t lose everything, just what's needed to repay your loan and keep the system solvent. The system is designed to **minimise risk**, not punish activity.

## How is IMF secured?

Every part of IMF is built on **trustless, battle-tested infrastructure**:

- **Amplify** uses [Uniswap v3](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview)  
- **Borrow** and **Lend** use [Morpho](https://morpho.org)  
- **USDS** is issued by [Sky](https://sky.money), creators of DAI  
- IMF’s own contracts have undergone **extensive audits** and we have an ongoing [bug bounty](https://hashlock.com/bug-bounty/imf) 

## Can I withdraw my USDS after lending?

Yes, as long as there is available liquidity. Lending markets are pooled and dynamic. If utilisation is high, withdrawals may require waiting for borrower repayments or new deposits.

## What tokens are supported?

You can view what tokens we support by visiting [our app](https://app.imf.bz). Tokens must meet strict [listing criteria](/docs/governance.html#listing-criteria), such as deep onchain liquidity and a reliable price oracle, to ensure markets remain healthy.

## Where does protocol revenue come from?

IMF earns a **6.9% performance fee** on interest paid by borrowers. That revenue accrues to the protocol’s treasury and is used to support growth.

## What is $IMF and what does it do?

$IMF is the protocol’s **token of power and influence.** It represents **economic control,** enabled by the [Salutary](https://salutary.io) standard and the Morpho framework. Check out [tokenomics](/docs/tokenomics) and [governance](/docs/governance) pages for full details.

## Is there a roadmap?

Not exactly. It’s more of a **vision board**. Key directions include:

- Supporting more tokens and communities  
- Growing the USDS lender base  
- Improving the IMF OS interface  
- Expanding to suitable L2s  
- Helping DAOs move from grants to credit
