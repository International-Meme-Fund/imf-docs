## What is IMF?

**IMF is a credit protocol** that lets anyone borrow against their tokens without selling. It combines liquidity provisioning (**Pool**), stablecoin borrowing (**Borrow**), and stablecoin lending (**Lend**). All built on [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org), [Morpho](https://morpho.org), and [USDS](https://sky.money).

## What does IMF stand for?

It originally stood for “International Meme Fund” but today, it’s simply **IMF**: a **credit cartel** for onchain coordination.

## What makes IMF different?

We unlock credit for the long tail. Not just blue chips. No governance theatre. No emissions. Just real tools for token communities to coordinate growth and access stable liquidity.

## Who is IMF for?

- Token holders who want liquidity without selling  
- Token communities that want to build and grow  
- Lenders seeking yield from real borrower demand  
- Builders who want capital without relying on grants

## What do I get by using IMF?

- Borrowers unlock stable liquidity (USDS) while staying long  
- Lenders earn interest paid by real borrowers  
- Communities get **credit rails** that reinforce price, attention, and belief

## What happens if my token crashes?

If your collateral value drops below safe levels, a **partial liquidation** may occur to protect lenders. You don’t lose everything, just the portion needed to keep the system solvent. The system is designed to **minimise risk**, not punish activity.

## How is IMF secured?

Every part of IMF is built on **trustless, battle-tested infrastructure**:

- **Pool** uses [Uniswap v3](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview)  
- **Borrow** and **Lend** use [Morpho Blue](https://morpho.org)  
- **USDS** is issued by [Sky](https://sky.money), creators of DAI  
- IMF’s own contracts have undergone **extensive audits** (*insert links to published audits here*)

## Can I withdraw my USDS after lending?

Yes, as long as there is available liquidity. Lending markets are pooled and dynamic. If utilisation is high, withdrawals may require waiting for borrower repayments or new deposits.

## What tokens are supported?

Any token can start by launching an **IMF Pool**. To unlock **Borrow** and **Lend**, the token must meet safety requirements, such as deep onchain liquidity and a reliable price oracle, to ensure markets remain healthy.

## Where does protocol revenue come from?

IMF earns a **6.9% performance fee** on interest paid by borrowers. That revenue accrues to the protocol’s treasury and is used to support growth.

## What is $IMF and what does it do?

$IMF is the protocol’s **ownership token**. It doesn’t govern or distribute rewards. It represents **economic control,** whoever holds 51% of the supply controls the protocol, enabled by the [Salutary](https://salutary.io) acquisition standard.

## Is there a roadmap?

Not exactly. It’s more of a **vision board**. Key directions include:

- Supporting more tokens and communities  
- Growing the USDS lender base  
- Improving the IMF OS interface  
- Expanding to suitable L2s  
- Helping DAOs move from grants to credit
