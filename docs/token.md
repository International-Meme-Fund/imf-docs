[International Meme Fund $IMF](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x59d813c1d0266278e2f5f146c0e222a6cfea83df){: target="_blank"} is our protocol equity token. An initial 269 ETH was raised by selling 20% of supply (originally 10% prior to burning 50% of tokens) in a public [Party presale](https://www.party.app/party/0xaaFE7aeE7da5dB8DD4a2D6a3e43F576876E6452E){: target="_blank"}. Our raise has been funding protocol development and bootstrapping of protocol liquidity. We've made a longterm commitment to build for weight and have partnered with [Salutary](https://salutary.io){: target="_blank"}, a new standard for tokens.
