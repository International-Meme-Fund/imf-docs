# Pool

IMF Pool is where tokens become productive.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

When a token is deposited into Pool, it’s paired with [USDS](https://sky.money){: target="_blank"} in a **protocol-optimised** [Uniswap v3](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview){: target="_blank"} liquidity position. This isn’t a farm. It’s **structured liquidity,** designed to generate real fees and enable lending.

## How It Works

- Users deposit a token into the Pool  
- The protocol deploys it into a Uniswap v3 position against USDS  
- LP fees are earned passively  
- USDS is periodically streamed out to fund the Borrow market

You deposit a single token: no need to pair it with USDS or manage an LP manually. **The protocol handles the strategy and rebalancing on your behalf.**

## Why It Matters

- Creates liquidity without relying on CEXs  
- Earns fees from real market activity  
- Feeds the flywheel by funding IMF Borrow

Pool is the gateway for tokens to participate in IMF. It’s where passive holders become active participants in a **credit-powered economy**.

**Hold it. Pool it. Put it to work.**
