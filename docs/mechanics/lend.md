# Lend

IMF Lend is where USDS earns yield.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

Lenders deposit [USDS](https://sky.money) into isolated credit markets and earn interest paid by borrowers. It’s **onchain**, **permissionless**, and **liquid.** Powered by [Morpho Blue](https://morpho.org), with all risk fully contained.

There are no emissions. No gimmicks. Just **real demand meeting real supply**.

### How It Works

- Lenders choose a token’s Borrow market (e.g., MOG–USDS)  
- They deposit USDS into the pool  
- Borrowers pay interest over time, which accrues to lenders

Each Lend market is **isolated.** You’re only exposed to the token you choose to support. **Utilisation drives rates**, and the system is transparent by design.

### Why It Matters

- Earn real yield from actual borrower demand  
- Support the tokens and communities you believe in  
- Coordinate with conviction, lending becomes a form of participation

Lending on IMF is more than passive income. It’s a way to back conviction and earn yield from **community-driven credit**.

**Put your USDS to work. Build while you earn.**
