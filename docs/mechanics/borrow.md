# Borrow

IMF Borrow lets token holders unlock stable liquidity without selling.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

By posting a token as collateral, users can borrow [USDS](https://sky.money){: target="_blank"} directly from an **isolated onchain market**. Everything is secured, immutable, and non-custodial. Powered by [Morpho Blue](https://morpho.org){: target="_blank"}.

This is not leverage for the sake of leverage. This is **credit with purpose.** Credit that lets you act without exiting your position.

## How It Works

- Borrowers deposit a supported token as collateral  
- They can borrow USDS up to a **77% LLTV** (max)  
- If the value of their collateral drops, the position risks **partial liquidation**  
- Users can repay anytime, reclaim their collateral, or top up to stay safe

Each Borrow market is **isolated:** one token, one oracle, one market. There is no shared risk across assets. **Defaults can’t cascade.** It’s clean credit infrastructure.

## Why It Matters

- No need to sell your token to access liquidity  
- Stay exposed while gaining stable working capital  
- Use USDS to fund ideas, support your community, or buy more of your token

IMF Borrow creates **skin in the game**. Borrowers are incentivised to grow the token they’ve posted. Because if it fails, they’re the ones who lose.

**It’s credit, aligned with conviction.**
