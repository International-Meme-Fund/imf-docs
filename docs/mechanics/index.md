# How It Works

IMF Credit unlocks credit using any token as collateral.

It works by coordinating three simple mechanisms:

- **Pool** - Where tokens are deposited into protocol-optimised [Uniswap v3](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/overview){: target="_blank"} liquidity positions  
- **Borrow** - Where holders borrow [USDS](https://sky.money){: target="_blank"} against their token collateral  
- **Lend** - Where lenders deposit USDS to earn yield from borrower demand

Each token has its own market. Each market is isolated. Every loop is **onchain**, **immutable**, and **transparent**.

## The Flywheel

1. Tokens are deposited into the **IMF Pool**
2. The Pool earns LP fees and streams USDS into the lending side
3. Borrowers post collateral and draw USDS from the market
4. Lenders earn interest from borrowers
5. Borrowed USDS often flows back into the token, creating coordinated price action
6. The cycle repeats, building attention, conviction, and value

## The Outcome

This is **not leverage for degens**. This is **credit infrastructure for the long tail**. The system works because incentives are aligned:

- Borrowers want their token to grow - so they repay
- Lenders want their yield - so they support real demand
- Communities want coordination - and now they have the tools to do it

Itâ€™s how a token becomes **creditworthy**. Not through hype. But through shared belief, onchain rails, and the ability to fund itself.

**No permission. No dilution. Just credit, unleashed.**
