Borrowing for any token and community-driven pooling.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

Our protocol introduces a novel mechanism that enables **borrowing for any token,** unlocking lending markets for assets that traditionally lack deep liquidity. This is achieved through a **community-driven pooling system,** allowing token communities to establish their own borrow markets in a sustainable and efficient manner.

The system consists of two primary components:

-   Pool provision, which creates a managed UniV3 LP position between TOKEN and DAI and deposits DAI into the Morpho pool.
-   Collateralised Debt Module, which allows borrow of DAI using TOKEN as collateral.
