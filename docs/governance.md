There is no DAO. Only the cartel.

**Not governance. Command.**

IMF is an autonomous organization. But not the kind you're used to. No forums. No endless votes. 

Just roles, rules, and onchain power.

## Cartel structure

Each role in the IMF Cartel maps directly to a core permission in the [Morpho](https://docs.morpho.org){: target="_blank"} framework. Here’s how our world of Boss(es), Fixers, Runners, and Plugs align with Morpho’s protocol architecture:

### **Boss** → [Owner](https://docs.morpho.org/curation/concepts/roles/#owner){: target="_blank"}

Black boilersuit. Final authority.

- Holds the keys  
- Routes treasury flows  
- Assigns and replaces all other roles

### **Fixers** → [Curator](https://docs.morpho.org/curation/concepts/roles/#curator){: target="_blank"}

 White lab coats. Turf tacticians.

- Add or remove markets  
- Adjust supply caps  
- Guide protocol direction

### **Runners** → [Allocator](https://docs.morpho.org/curation/concepts/roles/#allocator){: target="_blank"}

Red boilersuits. Liquidity logistics.

- Deploy USDS across markets  
- Manage capital allocation  
- Exercise $IMF as power

### **Agents** → [Guardian](https://docs.morpho.org/curation/concepts/roles/#guardian){: target="_blank"}

Embedded delegates. Protocol protectors.

- Defend turf  
- Prevent unwanted changes  
- Represent token communities

*These mappings ground our cartel-coded hierarchy in enforceable onchain logic.*

*Powered by [Morpho](https://docs.morpho.org/overview/){: target="_blank"} and the [Salutary standard](https://salutary.io){: target="_blank"}.*

*No soft power. Just the hard kind.*

## Bribes, not ballots

You don’t need a proposal. You need a position.

- Want your token listed? Accumulate $IMF.
- Want to influence markets? Signal conviction.
- Want to move the protocol? Raid the vault.

Not corruption. **Coordinated collusion**.

## Listing criteria

Not every token gets to play.

To be considered for listing as collateral in the IMF vault, your project must meet the following baseline requirements:

- **Deployed on Ethereum mainnet** – L2s may enter later, but mainnet is the proving ground.
- **At least $750k in reliable onchain liquidity** – Supports a stable oracle from our partner [DIA](https://diadata.org){: target="_blank"}.
- **Live oracle feed via DIA** – Deployed and funded with ETH to sustain adequate price updates.
- **Backchannel through snapshot.box** – Listings are prioritized based on standing in our [snapshot.box](https://snapshot.box/#/s:creditcartel.eth){: target="_blank"} space, where $IMF holders signal support by staking conviction.

There is no form. No pitch deck. Just one path forward:

**Accumulate $IMF. Bribe the cartel. Earn your spot on the board.**

We don’t list tokens. We **initiate them.**

## Conviction-based control

In IMF, power flows where belief concentrates. We don’t reward participation. We reward *positioning*.

- **$IMF is your access pass** – Bribe the cartel. Guide the protocol.
- **The vault is your battleground** – One vault. Many fronts. Credit is how you make moves.
- **Your wallet is your signal** – Bids don’t lie. Capital is conviction.

Cartel-coded coordination beats sterile governance theatre.

Governance isn’t a feature. It’s an outcome.  

## Cartel codebase

We don’t do constitutions. We do protocols.  

Enforcing order:

- Ethereum: The console  
- Your wallet: The controller  
- Morpho: The underlying engine  
- IMF: The operating system  
- $IMF: The cheat code

*Every protocol has a "DAO." We have a chain of command.*
