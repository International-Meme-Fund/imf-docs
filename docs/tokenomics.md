**$IMF isn’t [governance](/docs/governance.html){: target="_blank"}. It’s grip.** 

Economic. Executable. Influence you can wield as a weapon. 

## Ownership mechanics

- Protocol earns 6.9% of interest paid by borrowers
- Fee recipient decided by the Cartel Comptroller(s)
- Nothing unnecessary. No governance theatre

Ownership is onchain and operational. If you hold the majority, you *are* the Cartel Comptroller(s). Built on the [Salutary standard](https://salutary.io){: target="_blank"} for onchain acquisition and credible control.

## What $IMF makes possible

- **Playable Influence** – Guide protocol direction via market signals and cartel coordination  
- **Aligned with Usage** – More borrowing = more revenue = stronger cartel = more lending 
- **Credible Collateral** – $IMF isn’t just influence. We’re underwriters of the underworld.

If you want your token listed, you don’t write a proposal. You [buy $IMF](https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x59d813c1d0266278e2f5f146c0e222a6cfea83df){: target="_blank"}, hold it, signal, and raid the vault. This isn’t just corruption. It’s coordinated corruption.

## Token supply breakdown

**Max total supply: 33,000,000 (non-mintable)**
