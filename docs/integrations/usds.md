USDS is the stablecoin that powers IMF.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

Every Pool is paired with USDS. Every Borrow and Lend market uses USDS. Itâ€™s the stable layer that makes IMF **liquid**, **composable**, and **usable**.

USDS is issued by [Sky](https://sky.money){: target="_blank"}, the protocol formerly known as Maker DAO, creators of DAI and pioneers of onchain stablecoin systems.

### Why USDS?

- **Credible issuer** - a track record of building stable primitives  
- **DAO-friendly** - designed for integrations with onchain governance  
- **Composability-first** - easy to plug into protocols, treasuries, and L2s  
- **Peg stability** - backed by a diversified and transparent reserve

Choosing USDS gives IMF a stablecoin that fits our values: **onchain**, **modular**, and **trusted by serious builders**.

**A stable foundation for onchain credit.**
