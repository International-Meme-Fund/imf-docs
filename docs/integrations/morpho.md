# Morpho

IMF Borrow and Lend are built on [Morpho Blue](https://www.morpho.org).
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Morpho is the lending engine behind IMF’s credit system. A trustless framework for creating isolated, immutable lending markets for any token.

Each IMF market is deployed using Morpho’s [Multi-Market Factory](https://docs.morpho.org/overview/concepts/vault/), with its own parameters, oracle, and risk model. No governance. No shared risk. No hidden switches.

### Why Morpho?

- Isolated markets prevent cross-asset contagion  
- Immutable contracts enforce predictable logic  
- [Dynamic interest rates](https://docs.morpho.org/overview/concepts/irm) based on real utilisation  
- Battle-tested with billions in TVL

Morpho lets IMF offer credit without compromise. **Transparent, modular, and built for the long tail of Ethereum**.

**Credit, without the complexity. Security, without the governance.**
