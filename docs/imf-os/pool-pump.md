Pool Pump is a fun way to interact with IMF protocol that's tailored to degens. Users are presented with a Pump button once their community have pooled enough tokens to unlock lending. Using the pump button secures 1.5x spot leverage at a 33% LTV ratio. They can then manage their position from the Control Panel on IMF OS.
