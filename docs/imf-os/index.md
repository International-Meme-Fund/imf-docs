IMF is designed for users and builders alike, and as such, we consider IMF protocol our Operating System (OS) on which various apps are built. When using IMF OS, you will discover a familiar desktop interface inspired by the Macintosh System 1.

For those wishing to interact directly with the protocol we have the Control Panel advanced interface. While the likes of Pool Pump (our flagship consumer app) are showcased as desktop shortcuts that load natively, despite being standalone applications.

More information on our user interfacing is provided below and will be updated with upcoming apps as they approach their respective release dates.
